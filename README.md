# TBDex Wallet: Blink

## Overview
TBDex Wallet: Blink is a minimalist, user-friendly wallet application built on the tbDEX protocol. Our MVP focuses on providing seamless currency conversion and fast cross-border payments without the need for users to hold balances in the wallet.

## Key Features
1. **Quick Sign Up / Sign In**: Streamlined user onboarding with secure authentication.
2. **Blink**: Instantly convert between fiat and cryptocurrencies using the best available rates from multiple Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs).
3. **Instant Invoicing**: Generate and share invoices for quick and easy payments.

## Design Considerations

### Profitability
- **Transaction Fees**: We charge a small percentage fee on each conversion transaction.
- **Premium Features**: Future plans include offering premium features for power users and businesses.

### Optionality
- Our application aggregates offerings from multiple PFIs, presenting users with the best available rates.
- Users can view and compare different offerings before making a decision.

### Customer Management
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are created for each user during the sign-up process.
- Verifiable Credentials are obtained and securely stored, streamlining the KYC process for future transactions.
